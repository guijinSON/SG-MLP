# SG-MLP
The Official Pytorch Implementation for `Switch Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron(SG-MLP)`. Accepted at ACK 2021.

SG-MLP, a novel and attentionless architecture for Natural Language Understanding(NLU), achieves decent results in the GLUE benchmark without any help of the Attention Mechanism in both Pre-Training and FineTuning steps. The following repositiory contains demos, pretrained models, and supplementaries necessary for reproducing the results.

## Model Config & Pretrained Weights
We trained a total of three models `SG-MLP Small`, `SG-MLP Base` and `SG-MLP Large`.  
The following are the configuration for each models. Pretrained weights for all models are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FlXtvaC3ZaqOd5zE2lcPiyZ2oKvv1vi1?usp=sharing).

| SG-MLP         | Parameter | Tokenizer              | Corpus                         | Train Steps  |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `SG-MLP Small` | ` 67 M`   |  `bert-base-cased`     | `Book Corpus + Wiki`           | `110,000`    |  
| `SG-MLP Base`  | `125 M`   |  `roberta-base`        | `C4`                           | `200,000`    |  
| `SG-MLP Large` | `170 M`   |  `roberta-base`        | `C4`                           | `200,000`    |  

1. Load SG-MLP Base
```python

from SGMLP.models.model import build_base_model
from SGMLP.utils import apply_weight

PATH = '/weights/SGMLP_Base.pth'
base_model = build_base_model()
base_model = apply_weight(base_model,PATH)

```
2. Load SG-MLP Large
```python

from SGMLP.models.model import build_large_model
from SGMLP.utils import apply_weight

PATH = '/weights/SGMLP_Large.pth'
large_model = build_large_model()
large_model = apply_weight(large_model,PATH)

```



## Masked Language Modeling(MLM) Demo
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17tMXMTt76uw350toP75d-znSRb0DNLYr?usp=sharing)
  
SG-MLP trained on the C4 corpus, learns to predict proper grammer and commonsense knowledge. Refer to the codes below, or the Colab Notebook for a MLM demo ran by our model. (Make sure you have our pretrained model downloaded for the demo) 

```python

from SGMLP.models.model import build_large_model
from SGMLP.utils import SGMLP_inference, apply_weight

PATH = '/weights/SGMLP_Large.pth'
large_model = build_large_model(output_logits = True)
large_model = apply_weight(large_model,PATH)

SGMLP_inference('A bird has <mask> legs.',large_model)
```
